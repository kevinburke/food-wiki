food-wiki
=========

The goal here is to help you figure out where you should eat when you're in a new city.
The websites listed here should ideally meet the following criteria:

- Try to find the best food wherever it's found (strip mall, food truck, street cart, etc).

- Attributes like the decor, kid-friendliness, quality of service should take a back seat to the quality of the food.

- Site should ideally describe how to find each location (and hopefully include phone number and open hours, if they exist)

- Site should give a recommendation about the food - should I go? If so what dishes should I try?
